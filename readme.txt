AntiVirus Scanner Application
Overview
The AntiVirus Scanner Application is a comprehensive Python-based security tool designed to provide a user-friendly interface for scanning files 
for potential threats. It integrates with the VirusTotal API to offer robust virus detection, ensuring the safety and integrity of your files. 
Built with a modern GUI using Tkinter, this application is easy to use for individuals and professionals alike.

Features
File Scanning

Allows users to scan any file from their local system for potential threats.
Uses advanced hash-based detection with SHA-256 and a local virus signature database.
VirusTotal API Integration

Uploads files to VirusTotal for in-depth analysis by multiple antivirus engines.
Retrieves and displays detailed analysis reports in an easy-to-read tabular format.
Interactive User Interface

Modern GUI with enhanced user experience features such as hover effects and styled widgets.
Easy file browsing and real-time scan status updates.
Threat Handling

Detects viruses and prompts the user to delete infected files with confirmation dialogs.
Saves analysis reports in JSON format for future reference.
Dynamic File Type Identification

Identifies file types using MIME-based detection for added context during scanning.
Reports & Logs

Generates detailed JSON reports of VirusTotal analysis.
Saves the last analysis results in a structured table format for quick review.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

os - File system interactions.
hashlib - SHA-256 hashing for file integrity verification.
magic - File type identification.
requests - Integration with the VirusTotal API.
tkinter - Interactive graphical user interface.
pandas - Tabular representation of analysis results.
PIL (Pillow) - Image handling for icons.
External API:

VirusTotal API for multi-engine virus detection.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
Required Python libraries. Install dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install magic pyfiglet requests pillow pandas
VirusTotal API key (replace API_KEY in the code with your own).
Running the Application
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/antivirus-scanner.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd antivirus-scanner
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python antivirus_scanner.py
How It Works
File Browsing: Users can select a file using the "Browse" button.
Scanning: Upon clicking "Scan File", the application:
Calculates the SHA-256 hash of the file.
Checks the hash against a local signature database.
Uploads the file to VirusTotal (if enabled) for multi-engine scanning.
Report Generation:
Displays detailed analysis results in the terminal and saves them in JSON format.
Threat Detection:
Alerts users if the file is infected and offers to delete it.

Security and Privacy
File uploads to VirusTotal are subject to their privacy policy. Ensure you comply with privacy standards before scanning sensitive files.
Planned Enhancements
Add support for scheduled scans and real-time monitoring.
Integrate cloud storage scanning capabilities.
Expand the local signature database for offline scans.
This project demonstrates the power of Python and third-party APIs for building practical security tools.
